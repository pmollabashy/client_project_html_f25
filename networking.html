    <h2>Expanding Your Network for Career Success</h2>
    <h3><strong>Why is Networking Important?</strong></h3>
    <p>
    Networking is an important part of any career journey. Forming connections not only opens doors to new professional opportunities, but also provides you with valuable learning experiences and support along the way. Networking helps you make confident career decisions, gain important knowledge in your chosen field, and expand your professional circle. Strong networking skills empower you to navigate your career path more effectively, stay informed about current trends, and uncover opportunities that align with your personal and professional goals.
    </p>
    <p>
    At UMSI, we seek to equip students with the resources they need to build strong and meaningful connections with alumni, peers, and prospective employers. We highly encourage students to take advantage of opportunities provided by UMSI to expand their networks and build valuable relationships.

    <h3>Networking Tips & Tricks for Career Success</h3>
    <ul class="card-list">
        <li><strong>When to Start:</strong> It's never too early to begin building your network. Join clubs, attend networking events, and connect with classmates and professors, whether that's in the classroom or on platforms like LinkedIn.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Genuine:</strong> Networking isn't simply about knowing as many people as possible. Build real, meaningful relationships with people by exhibiting genuine interest in them and what they do.</li>
        <li><strong>Sell Yourself:</strong> What's interesting about you? Why should people want to work with you? Prepare an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1633aBaWXIZW_ImTP-jKKN0QNXK9-RpXXmVznRgA4ZHQ/edit?tab=t.0">elevator pitch</a> to teach others about who you are, what you're good at, and what you're seeking.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Connections Alive:</strong> After speaking with someone, follow up with them to express your appreciation for their time. Keep your connections alive by regularly engaging with your network. Attend events, send messages back and forth, and engage on social media to keep conversations going.</li>
